# Analytics in Retail

## Overview
In the competitive retail market, optimizing service business processes is crucial for meeting customer expectations and achieving profitability. This project leverages data analytics throughout the retail process to track emerging popular products, forecast sales and future demand through predictive simulation, and optimize product placements and offers via heat-mapping of customers. 

## Data Availability
This project utilizes the `Retail Data.xlsx` file, which includes three sheets with the following data:

- **Customer**: Contains demographic and other information about customers.
- **Transaction**: Records transactions made by customers.
